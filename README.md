# Land_Sat

This project focuses on land use scene classification using deep learning models to categorize aerial or satellite images into 21 distinct land-use types such as agricultural, beach, forest, and residential areas. Three pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures—MobileNetV3Large, MobileNetV3Small, ResNet101V2, ResNet50V2 and hybrid model—were fine-tuned on the dataset to extract rich spatial features for accurate scene recognition. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance objectively. The models were trained using transfer learning with a softmax classifier for multi-class prediction. The system achieved effective classification performance, demonstrating the potential of CNN-based architectures in automated land-use mapping and environmental monitoring.
